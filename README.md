 ## About project
this project, we'll code a simple 2D game to get familiar with the minilibix_42 library and UI in general. In my case it will be ninja.

### Game Rules
The game we choose must follow a set of rules. The executable ``so_long`` and ``so_long_bonus`` for bonus part, They will receive a map as the only argument, and the map file name should be a ``.ber`` filetype.

To run the game, we must write a valid map according to the following rules :
- Only ``P`` *(ninja)*, ``1`` *(wall)*, ``0`` *(free space)*, ``C`` *(key ðŸ”‘)*, and ``E`` *(exit)* will be accepted ``Z`` *(enemy)* in our map (except if you add enemies as bonus)
- The map must be rectangular, i.e. all rows must have the same length
- There must be at least one exit, one player, and one collectible on the map
- The map must be closed, i.e. surrounded by walls

### The player has to reach all keys to finish the game
- in this one you need to know [flood fill](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=flood+fill+algorithm+in+c) algorithm

If any of these checks fail, the game must end with ``Error\n`` followed by a error type.
 
## How it Works
For the graphics part of the project we used a library called ``minilibx`` by :
   ```C
 #include <mlx.h>
```
#### Part 1: read map from file

In this step after validating the map then continued by reading the file  line by line with [get_next_line](https://github.com/joseph-el/42_get_next_line).
Once that was done I filled a struct ``t_data`` with some basic map attributes like number of players, exits, key, number of rows and columns, etc. whcih was later useful when creating a matrix with [ft_split](https://github.com/joseph-el/42_libft_project/blob/master/ft_split.c). with ``\n`` as the separator.

#### Part 2: installation 

### Cloning the repositories
```shell
git clone https://github.com/joseph-el/42_so_long_2Dgame.git
cd so_long
make
```

### Installing the MLX library

* ``Linux``

If you're not using a MacOS computer from 42, you'll need to install the libraries manually. Please refer to the [official github](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) for more details. To install it, do the following (requires root access):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux.git
cd minilibx-linux/
make
sudo cp mlx.h /usr/include
sudo cp libmlx.a /usr/lib
```

* ``MacOS``

To install the library, you will need to first install a package manager like homebrew (check [here](https://brew.sh/)) to then install the X11 package with ``brew install Xquartz``. After that you must extract the minilibx file called ``minilibx_opengl.tgz``. Then install it to your system with the following commands (requires sudo as well):

```shell
cd minilibx_opengl
make
sudo cp mlx.h /usr/local/include
sudo cp libmlx.a /usr/local/lib
sudo reboot
```
Note: A reboot is necessary to ensure that the ``Xquartz`` is working properly. You can test if it is by running a test example with the command ``xeyes``.

### Installing the manuals

If you want quick access to the mlx manuals, it is recommended that you copy the files from the ``man`` folder in [minilibx-linux](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) to your system manuals:

* ``Linux``
```shell
sudo cp man/man3/* /usr/share/man/man3/
```
Note: Depending on your Linux configuration, to get the manuals working (e.g. ``man mlx``) you will need to individually gzip all the manual files you just copied, e.g. ``sudo gzip /usr/share/man/man3/mlx.3``.

* ``MacOS``
```shell
sudo cp man/man3/* /usr/X11/share/man/man3
```


#### Part 3: How to play
---
###### Maps
* the map can only contain some of the following characters:

| Character | Object |
| - | - |
| 1 | Wall. |
| 0 | free space. |
| C | key. |
| E | Exit. |
| P | Player position. |
| Z | Enemy (bonus part)|

###### Control
- Use 'WASD' to move. You move the player every time, in the bonus part when you add some enemies (fire), you will die when you move in the fire.
- After picking up all the keys, the exits open and you can leave to see how many moves you used to solve the map.
- You can close it with ``esc``.

###### Execute the game
for start play you can use some of the makefile rules, or execute the file ``so_long/so_long_bonus`` if it's been generated, passing the map you want to play as parameter (``./so_long "path of your map"``). The make file has the following rules:

| Rule | Function |
| - | - |
| ``make`` | Generates tools.a liberty and so_long executable |
| ``make bonus`` | Generates tools.a liberty and so_long_bonus executable |
| ``make clean`` | Deletes all object files of tools.a and so_long/so_long_bonus|
| ``make fclean`` | Deletes tools.a and the object files of tools.a and the so_long/so_long_bonus|
| ``make re`` | makes ``fclean`` and ``make`` again. |
